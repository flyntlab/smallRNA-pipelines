# smallRNA-pipelines
This will be the smallRNA pipeline for the analysis of RNA-seq data. (This will be for Andrei)

## Requirements
Linux Environment with standard Bioinformatics tools (Bowtie, Samtools, Bedtools, etc.)


## Initial Data-Cleaning:

### process_fastqs.sh
Splits raw fastq RNA-seq reads into constituent files for downstream analysis.

### miRNA

### siRNA

### piRNA

#### cram_creation.sh
Converts Bam file to cram file: (Use cram compression only when bam file size very large)
